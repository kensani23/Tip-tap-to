Tools used: [Visual Studio. an application that we used strictly for coding.]

Concepts used: [in Object Orientated programming we learnt about ]

Assumptions: [we expect that the user will be someone who is familiar with coding language called java. ]

Limitations: [due to an encounter with a hardware problem while trying to run android studio, this program is only ran on visual studio. thus this means that thsi project is only for people who know the programming language. due to insufficient time, we were also unable to ensure that we use GUI or Java Swing in our code. ]
