Project title: [TipTapTo]

Project page: [https://github.com/kensani23/Tip-tap-to]

Instructions for use (allowable actions): [Provide DETAILED  instructions on how to run AND interact with your program. If we cannot run it with relative ease, it will NOT be marked! So if it needs to be saved in a specific folder, or needs Internet access, or needs anything beyond simply double clicking the executable, document all that here. This is very IMPORTANT! Also, list all forms of interaction here, so if your program allows the user to press ‘Q’ to exit, or ‘left arrow’ or ‘right arrow’ to do specific things, document that here as well. If we cannot figure out how to interact with your program and nothing is documented, it will NOT be marked!]

Tools used: [Visual Studio. an application that we used strictly for coding.]

Concepts used: [in Object Orientated programming we learnt about ]

Assumptions: [we expect that the user will be someone who is familiar with coding language called java. ]

Limitations: [due to an encounter with a hardware problem while trying to run android studio, this program is only ran on visual studio. thus this means that thsi project is only for people who know the programming language. due to insufficient time, we were also unable to ensure that we use GUI or Java Swing in our code. ]
